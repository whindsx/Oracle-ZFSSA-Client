=head1 NAME

Oracle::ZFSSA::Client - Oracle ZFS Storage RESTful API Connector

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   use Oracle::ZFSSA::Client;

   $zfssa = new Oracle::ZFSSA::Client(
      user => $user,
      password => $password,
      host => "your.appliance.org"
   );

   $json_param = {
      your => 'params',
      but  => 'not required',
   };

   $json_result = $zfssa->call('POST','/api/storage/v1/method',$json_param)

   # See ex/example.pl for more examples:
   #     https://github.com/whindsx/Oracle-ZFSSA-Client/blob/master/ex/example.pl 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This Perl module provides a simplified means of connecting to and
executing commands against an Oracle ZFSSA RESTful Application
Programming Interface. Responses are Perl C<JSON> data structures.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

$zfssa = Oracle::ZFSSA::Client->new( %options )

This method creates a new C<Oracle::ZFSSA::Client> and returns it.

   Key                 Default
   -----------         -----------
   user                undef (Required)
   password            undef (Required)
   host                undef (Required)
   port                215
   ssl                 1
   verify_hostname     1
   debug               0

ssl - Connect to the API over HTTPS.

verify_hostname - Disable SSL certificate verification.

debug - Turns on raw HTTP request/response output from C<LWP::UserAgent>.

=head1 METHODS

There is only one C<Oracle::ZFSSA::Client> method:

=head2 call

   $zfssa->call('GET','/api/storage/v1/pools');

The first parameter is the HTTP method, this is required.
The second parameter is the ZFSSA API method, this is also required.
The third and optional parameter is a hash of API parameters that will 
become C<JSON> encoded.
